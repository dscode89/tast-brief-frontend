- make hero image work for images of different sizes

  - right now it's only working because I have moved the image to the bottom with background-position

- need to go through and make sure that everything is properly atomic design structured. Be Nitpicky with what is a molecule and what is an element

- also need to have a look into how to inject mock data when rendering templates vs pages
- once initial landing page is set up, look into testing for future parts of the webpage application

- add some styling/animaton to header button so that it grows in size when hovered over and maybe changes color

- could possibly make the ImgContainer more descriptive

  - have a think about what attributes you would want to make

- refactor so that the the product column isn't being used for the footer list and products

  - they have too many differences

- RESPONSIVENESS OF EVERYTHING

- first hero should probably have an action also

- refactor NavLinksBurgerMenu - feels too wet.
